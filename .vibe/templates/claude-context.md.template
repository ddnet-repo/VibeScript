```

---

## Architectural Constraints

List any architectural decisions or constraints Claude must follow:

- `{{CONSTRAINT_1}}`
- `{{CONSTRAINT_2}}`
- `{{CONSTRAINT_3}}`

---

## Things to Avoid

List specific anti-patterns or approaches to avoid in this project:

- ❌ `{{AVOID_1}}`
- ❌ `{{AVOID_2}}`
- ❌ `{{AVOID_3}}`

---

## Project-Specific Vocabulary

Define domain-specific terms and concepts:

- **`{{TERM_1}}`**: `{{DEFINITION_1}}`

## Integration with VibeScript

VibeScript governance is `[ ] Enabled  [ ] Disabled` for this project.

If enabled, Claude must:
1. Read `.vibe/claude.instructions.md` before making changes
2. Create `.vibe.*` files with all 13 required directives (goal, touch, inputs, outputs, constraints, tests, risk, rollback, security, performance, dependencies, observability, breaking)
3. Declare all touched files in `@vibe:touch` directives
4. Run `vibe:check` and `vibe:guard` before committing
5. Follow file ownership rules

**Note**: VibeScript now requires 5 additional production-focused directives. See `docs/development-patterns.md` for guidance on how to fill these out at different pattern levels.

## Quick Reference

**One-Line Summary**: 
```
{{PATTERN_SUMMARY}}
```

Example: `"Strict YAGNI, Moderate DRY, TDD with 80% coverage, Full JSDoc, Fail-fast errors, Atomic commits"`

## Example Filled Template

Here's an example of how to fill this template:

### Project Information
- **Project Name**: E-Commerce API
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Express
- **Project Phase**: ✓ Production

### Selected Development Patterns

**Core Philosophy**:
- ✓ YAGNI: Moderate
- ✓ DRY: Moderate  
- ✓ SOLID: Pragmatic

**Testing Approach**:
- ✓ Method: Test-After Development
- ✓ Coverage: Pragmatic (60%+)

**Error Handling**:
- ✓ Strategy: Fail-Fast at boundaries, graceful degradation internally

**Documentation**:
- ✓ Level: Full JSDoc for public APIs, inline comments for complex logic

**Commit Style**:
- ✓ Size: Atomic
- ✓ Scope: Surgical

**Production Directives**:
- ✓ Security: Defense in depth - validate all inputs, require auth, prevent injection
- ✓ Performance: Document complexity and scale requirements
- ✓ Dependencies: List all external services and version requirements
- ✓ Observability: Include logging, metrics, and traces for debugging
- ✓ Breaking: Explicitly state breaking changes or "none"

### Custom Instructions
```
- All database queries must use the repository pattern
- API responses must match the JSON:API specification
- All external API calls must have retry logic with exponential backoff
- Use Zod for runtime validation of all inputs
- Prefer functional programming style where appropriate
```

### Architectural Constraints
- No business logic in controllers (must be in services)
- Database schema changes require migration files
- All secrets must be in environment variables, never hardcoded

### Things to Avoid
- ❌ Don't use `any` type in TypeScript
- ❌ Don't query database from controllers
- ❌ Don't add dependencies without checking for vulnerabilities

### Project-Specific Vocabulary
- **SKU**: Stock Keeping Unit, unique product identifier
- **Cart**: User's shopping cart, stored in Redis with 24hr TTL
- **Fulfillment**: Process of packing and shipping orders

## Usage Instructions

1. **Fill out this template** with your project's patterns and constraints
2. **Save it** as `.vibe/claude-context.md` in your project
3. **Reference it** when tasking Claude:

   ```
   "Claude, read .vibe/claude-context.md for this project's 
   development patterns, then implement the user registration feature."
   ```

4. **Update it** as patterns evolve or as you learn what works
